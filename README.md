# rate-rented-accommodation

My individual software project for my MSc. 

A web application for users to rate the most common issues within their rented accommodation.

The following technologies for development of this project are:
1. HTML/ CSS/ JavaScript/ PHP
2. Bootstrap Framework
3. Google Maps API
4. MySQL Server and Database


The purpose of this project is to provide tenants a better understanding of the
day-to-day living conditions in an accommodation that they are considering to move into. 
Indeed to ensure that they know what they are in for and ideally prevent them from living 
in uncomfortable conditions that they would be paying large sums of money for.
